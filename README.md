## 🧱 Core Java Concepts Covered

### 🔹 1. What is Java?
Java is a platform-independent, object-oriented programming language widely used for enterprise backend development, Android apps, and APIs.

---

### 🔹 2. Reserved Words in Java
Keywords like `class`, `public`, `if`, `else`, etc. are reserved and cannot be used as variable or class names.  
➡️ See: `Variables/ReservedWordsExample.java`

---

### 🔹 3. Identifiers
Identifiers are names for variables, methods, classes. Must start with a letter, `_`, or `$` and cannot use reserved keywords.  
➡️ See: `Variables/IdentifiersDemo.java`

---

### 🔹 4. Variables and Data Types
Understand how to declare variables and assign values with correct types.  
➡️ See: `Variables/VariableDeclaration.java`

#### 🔸 Integer Types
| Type  | Size    | Range                   |
|-------|---------|--------------------------|
| byte  | 8-bit   | -128 to 127              |
| short | 16-bit  | -32,768 to 32,767        |
| int   | 32-bit  | -2^31 to 2^31-1          |
| long  | 64-bit  | -2^63 to 2^63-1          |

➡️ See: `Variables/UnderstandingByte_Short_Int_Long/`

#### 🔸 Floating Point Types
- `float`: 32-bit, less precision  
- `double`: 64-bit, default for decimal numbers  
➡️ See: `Variables/FloatingPointTypesDemo.java`

#### 🔸 char and boolean
- `char`: Unicode character  
- `boolean`: true or false  
➡️ See: `Variables/CharBooleanDemo.java`

## 💡 New Additions

### 📌 Accepting Input from User
Learn how to use `Scanner` to read input from console for `int`, `double`, `String`, etc.  
➡️ See: `Accepting_Input_From_User/InputDemo.java`

---

### 📌 Implicit Type Casting
Covers automatic data type conversion (e.g., int to double).  
➡️ See: `Implicit_TypeCasting/ImplicitCastingExample.java`

---

### 📌 Explicit Type Casting
Covers manual conversion using syntax like `(int)` or `(float)`, with warnings on data loss.  
➡️ See: `Explicit_TypeCasting/ExplicitCastingExample.java`

---

### 📌 Operators in Java
Includes arithmetic (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`), relational (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`), and logical (`&&`, `||`, `!`) operators with examples.  
➡️ See: `Operators/ArithmeticOperators.java`, etc.

---

### 📌 Swapping Two Variables Using a Third Variable
Classic swap logic with step-by-step explanation.  
➡️ See: `Swap_Two_Variables_Using_Third_Variable/SwapDemo.java`
